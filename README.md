### Number of Trips, Drivers, and Fares in Different Categories of Cities 
The numbers of trips, drivers, and average rates vary significantly amongst the three categories of cities. Urban areas have more riders, drivers, and revenue than suburban or rural counterparts. 


### Distance traveled and average fare by city. 
Varying sorts of cities have notably different average fares for rides and drivers. The average cost of a ride and driver is highest in less crowded areas and lowest in more populated ones.

## Summary

### Here are three recommendations for the CEO based on our analysis of the ride-sharing data to account for variations across city types: 
 - Boost city-specific marketing and community engagement to expand the PyBer brand and capture a larger market share. 
 - Since there are fewer rides and drivers in suburban and rural areas, offering incentives or special discounts may be worthwhile to attract and retain drivers there. 
 - The data should be analyzed regularly to track changes and identify opportunities for improvement in urban areas of all types.
