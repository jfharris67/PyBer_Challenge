# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this new analysis is to examine the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types (rural, suburban, and urban). This analysis will provide insights on trends and patterns in the data, and ultimately help inform decision making and strategy for the CEO of PyBer.

## Results

### Total Rides, Drivers, and Fares by City Type
We can see that the number of rides, drivers, and fares differ greatly among the three city types. Rural cities have the fewest total rides, drivers, and fares, while urban cities have the most.

Average Fare per Ride and Driver by City Type
Additionally, we can see that the average fare per ride and per driver also differs among the city types. On average, rural cities have the highest fares per ride and per driver, while urban cities have the lowest.

City Type	Average Fare per Ride	Average Fare per Driver
Rural	$34.62	$55.49
Suburban	$30.97	$39.50
Urban	$24.53	$16.57
Total Fare by City Type
Finally, we can see that the total fare by city type follows a similar trend as the other metrics. Rural cities have the lowest total fares, while urban cities have the highest.

City Type	Total Fare
Rural	$4,327.93
Suburban	$19,356.33
Urban	$39,854.38
Summary

Based on the analysis of the ride-sharing data, we recommend the following three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:

Increase marketing and outreach efforts in urban cities to further expand the PyBer brand and capture a larger share of the market.
Consider offering incentives or promotions to attract and retain drivers in suburban and rural cities, as these areas have fewer total rides and drivers compared to urban cities.
Analyze the data on a regular basis to monitor trends and identify opportunities for growth and improvement in all city types.
