### Number of Trips, Drivers, and Fares in Different Categories of Cities 
The numbers of trips, drivers, and average rates vary significantly amongst the three categories of cities. Urban areas have more riders, drivers, and revenue than suburban or rural counterparts. 


### Distance traveled and average fare by city. 
Varying sorts of cities have notably different average fares for rides and drivers. The average cost of a ride and driver is highest in less crowded areas and lowest in more populated ones.

## Summary

### Here are three recommendations for the CEO based on our analysis of the ride-sharing data to account for variations across city types: 
 - Find ways to increase driver recruitment and incentives for rural areas to increase the number of rides and fares. The study shows that rural areas has low number of rides and total fares and high average fare per ride and drivers. Increasing the number of drivers in these areas, PyBer could improve access to its services and make them more competitive against other companies.
 - Consider adjusting prices in suburban areas to increase rides and fares. The data indicates that suburban areas have a high number of rides and fares with a lower average fare per ride and driver against urban areas. By adjusting prices, PyBer could make its services attractive to suburban riders and increasing its market share in those areas.
 - The data shows urban areas have the highest number of rides and total fares and the lowest average fare per ride and driver.  Technology and infrastructure investments could improve service.
